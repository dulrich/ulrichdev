# Minimal Coffeescript Server #

This server exists to power my personal website.
Secondary purposes include experimenting wtih Coffeescript, promises, and other modules.

Installation is the standard `npm install`.
`coffee server.coffee` to run, or `coffee -c server.coffee && node server.js` or `make dev` to run the compiled version with file-watching.
