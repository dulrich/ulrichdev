# DIY Soaps, Lotions, and other Personal Care Products #

Looking for an excuse to use my digital scale, and having dry/sensitive skin, I decided to try making my own.

## Basic Ingredients ##

These basic ingredients are used in various recipes.
Look for them in your pantry or online at [Bulk Apothecary](http://www.bulkapothecary.com) for the more specialized substances.

* [beeswax](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/raw-ingredients/waxes/beeswax-we-offer-both-white-and-yellow.html)
* coconut oil
* olive oil
* [shea butter](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/shea-butter.html)


## Lotion Bars / Lip Balm ##

Basic bar: ratios by weight.
A little bit bland by itself, this recipe works well with a few drops of essential oil per bar.

* 4 parts beeswax
* 5 parts coconut oil
* 5 parts shea butter

Butter Bar: a smooth, healing bar.
This recipe melts easily due to the liquid oils, and makes a very nice lip balm.
Lip balm screw-up tubes take around 5g of lotion, so I pour the bars I'm making, then the tubes and finally top off the bars.

* 4 parts beeswax
* 1 part jojoba oil
* optional, 1 part almond oil for vitamin E
* 5 parts cocoa butter
* 5 parts shea butter

** For lip balm, I prefer standard screw-up  [tubes](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/make-it/lip-balm/lip-balm-containers/empty-lip-balm-tubes.html). You will want a small funnel for filling.

Improved Bar: combines the best features of previous experiments for an improved consistency.

* 5 parts beeswax
* 6 parts coconut oil
* 3 parts shea butter
* 3 parts cocoa butter
* 2 parts jojoba and/or almond oil
* 1 part arrowroot powder
* essential oils as desired


## Deodorant ##

For standard [tubes](http://www.bulkapothecary.com/make-it/personal-care-products/containers/empty-deodorant-white-plastic-containers-bag-of-50.html) or [tubes](http://www.amazon.com/Deodorant-Containers-New-Empty-Pack/dp/B00CMF4CIM), net weight was 77g.
The recipe used was the same as lotion, with the addition of arrowroot powder and baking soda.

* 20g beeswax
* 25g coconut oil
* 25g shea butter
* 2T arrowroot powder
* 1.5t baking soda
