# David Ulrich - Software Engineer (and some other things) #

When I'm not ~~banging my head on the desk~~ writing code for pleasure or profit, you will likely find me drinking loose leaf tea, cooking delicious plant-based meals, biking, or swimming in the lake.

My programming interests include function programming, relational programming, and DSLs.

Mostly I hack in Javascript/NodeJS or Coffeescript, but I am also cool with Bash, C, Python, or whatever happens to be the best tool for the job at hand.

For some code examples, see descriptions on my [projects](/projects) page or repos on [github](http://github.com/dulrich).
