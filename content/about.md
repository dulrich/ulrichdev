# David Ulrich &ndash; Software Engineer (and some other things)

![David Ulrich](/static/img/avatar.jpg)

When I'm not ~~banging my head on the desk~~ writing code for pleasure or profit, you will likely find me drinking loose leaf tea, cooking, baking, reading, shooting [photos](/photos), biking, or swimming.

My technical interests include functional programming, relational programming, component-entity systems, and DSLs.

Mostly I hack in Javascript/NodeJS or Coffeescript, but I am also cool with Bash, C/C++, Python, Lua, really whatever happens to be the best tool for the job at hand. Working in a variety of languages expands the available ways of looking at any given problem, increasing the chance of finding a good solution quickly.

For some code examples, see descriptions on my [projects](/projects) page or repos at [github](http://github.com/dulrich).
