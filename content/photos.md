## Critters ##

* [dead snake](/static/img/snake.jpg) - this poor dead [northern watersnake](http://www.tennsnakes.org/watersnake.htm) made me jump when I turned around from looking at black walnuts
* [turtle](/static/img/turtle.jpg) - probably an [eastern spiny softshell turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_softshell_turtle)
* [mantis](/static/img/mantis.jpg) - technically a [Carolina mantis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_mantis)
