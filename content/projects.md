# Some of my non-Work Projects #

## ulrichdev

The minimal webserver for this site is written in coffeescript on top of nodejs, and leverages many npm modules for the heavy lifting. The framework uses toffee for templating, and the guts of each page are simple markdown files.

## fdb: streamlined cli budget management

Part expense tracking and budgeting, and part lua development experiment.
The goals of this project were to replace a simple accounting spreadsheet, and
also experiment with developing a (slightly) nontrivial application in lua.
Planned extensions include a curses interface.

* [fdb](https://github.com/trakk/fdb) -- github project link
* [lua](http://lua.org) -- lua is a small and fast scripting language, popular for embedding in C/C++ programs
* [luasql](http://keplerproject.github.io/luasql/doc/us/manual.html) -- mySQL database adapter for lua
