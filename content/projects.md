The minimal webserver for this site is written in coffeescript on top of nodejs, and leverages many npm modules for the heavy lifting. The framework uses toffee for templating, and the guts of each page are simple markdown files.

* [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) -- CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
* [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express) -- Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [consolidate.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js) -- Template engine consolidation library for express
* [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) -- A full-featured markdown parser and compiler, written in JavaScript. Built for speed.
* [toffee](https://github.com/malgorithms/toffee) -- Toffee is a templating language, based on the simplicity and beauty of CoffeeScript.
