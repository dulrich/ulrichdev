# 2014-08-04 -- grep LANG=C, grep -P 10x Faster #

While doing some tests of a non-POSIX-compliant search pattern,
I discovered that `grep -PiIr foo ./` seemed to output much faster than `grep -EiIr foo ./`.

Sure enough there was an order of magnitude difference in the real/user time of the commands:

```
	time grep -EiIr foo ./
	
	real	0m1.576s
	user	0m1.563s
	sys 	0m0.034s
	
	time grep -PiIr foo ./
	
	real	0m0.134s
	user	0m0.124s
	sys 	0m0.030s
```

All other things being equal, it seemed that `-P`, the perl-compatible switch 
(which `man grep` warns is "highly experimental") ought to be slower than `-E`
or just plain old `grep`. After some reading, it turns out that setting the 
language processing environment variable brings the runtime down to `-P` levels:

```
	time LANG=C grep -EiIr foo ./
	
	real	0m0.150s
	user	0m0.127s
	sys 	0m0.031s
```

Whether the speed of `-P` is related to language handling is unclear.
Its performance does not seem to be impacted by the setting.

Possible updates to follow if more info becomes available.
