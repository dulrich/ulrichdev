# 2015-11-15 -- Looking Back on the "Year of Commits"

From August 25 2014 to August 24 2015, I completed a personal challenge, which
was to push at least one commit to my github repositories every day. The results
were mostly good. Yes, there were some days of low motivation when sub-optimal
code, or minor tweaks were all that got pushed.

But looking at the contributions chart now shows a sharp cutoff at the end of
the challenge:

![Nov 15 -Nov 15 github contributions](/static/img/github-contrib-stats.jpg)

From the standpoint of what happened after the challenge ended, even if 50% of
commits during the daily coding period were trivial/rubbish, that discipline
still resulted in a large amount of code getting written that otherwise would
not exist at all.

The new goal is to restart daily coding, with the focuses being on pushing high-quality
commits whenever possible, and finding a pattern for coding so that it can be a
sustainable long-term routine, instead of feeling like a chore on many days.
