Standards: you complain when others don't follow them and when you have to,
for the same reason in both cases: it means extra work for you.

This conflict between who works and who benefits is the origin of 'double' standards.

Some C and C++ programmers dispute this origin, saying that `double standards;`
is simply a declaration with no value.
