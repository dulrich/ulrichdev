## Considerate Comedian

A silicon valley exec hires a comedian for his son's birthday party, and asks
how long the show will be.
"Probably an hour," the comedian tells him, "I can only tell up to 255 jokes."
"Why's that?"
"I don't want to pollute their minds, so I keep childrens' shows 8-bit clean."


## Preferred Language

A Mexican developer goes to a gamedev interview:
Interviewer: Can you program?
Developer: c, se√±or
